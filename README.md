This application has been built to take part in NLP4TM 2016 Shared Task. Task was about to clean translation memory of three language 
pair - English - German, English - Italian and English - Spanish. We have followed rule based approach here. This application does not take any command line argument. One has to change the file names in 'main' method. Two file names needs to be modified 'inputFile' and 'outputFile'. 'inputFile' is the TM file which needs to be cleaned. 'outputFile' is the output file where clean TM will be saved. Here cleaning means just to classify the TM sentences as correct or wrong. 'inputFile' stored source sentence and target sentence separated by tab. 'outputFile' stores source sentence, target sentence and the class label (1 as correct and 3 as wrong) separated by tab.
